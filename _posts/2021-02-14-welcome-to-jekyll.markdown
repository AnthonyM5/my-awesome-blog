Jekyll is a static site generator written by GitHub's co-founder Tom Preston-Werner.  Jekyll is designed to be simple - no database set ups and generates static webpages with HTML & CSS.  Jekyll is also blog-aware, so it has support for blog features like permalinks, categories, pages, posts, layouts, etc to make importing/migrating existing blogs simple.

# For our purposes we will be using Jekyll to create a blog:

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. 

# Front Matter
Next up is to add the necessary [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/): 
The front matter YAML block in your file helps Jekyll process and build your pages using either predefined variables (you can also create your own custom variables).
