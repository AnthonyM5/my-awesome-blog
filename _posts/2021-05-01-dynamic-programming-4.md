title: Dynamic Programming - Decision Procedures, and Optimizations Part 2
---

In a similar vein to our summing problems from last week, we are tweaking our approach to tackle string construction.  Our decision procedure will be an algorithm that determines whether a word can be constructed from a array bank of strings.  

For example if we want to construct the word skateboard using the bank of strings ["bo", "rd", "ate", "t", "ska", "sk", "boar"] we can construct a recursive tree to test each element in the array.  Our initial branches will have to be a prefix of the original word, so in our case "ska", or "sk", and then we would test the remaining elements until we return a base case of an empty string (meaning we have constructed our word), or we end up with a string that we can no longer remove a prefix from.

Our recursive function would look something like this:
Javascript strings have a prototype method [indexOf()][1] that we can use to determine if the search term is in the string, and return the starting index, and combined with the [slice()][2] method we can also create our suffix like in our tree.

{% highlight javascript %}

const canConstruct = (target, wordBank) => {

//Base case

    if (target === '') {
        return true
    }

//We then want to iterate through the word bank

    for (let string of wordBank) {

//If our element is a prefix of the target, this should return 0

    if (target.indexOf(string) === 0) {

//Using slice with the length of the string to find our suffix

    let suffix = target.slice(string.length)

//We recursively call our *canConstruct* on this suffix 
//return early if we hit base case

        if (canConstruct(suffix, wordBank) === true) {
            return true
            }
        } 
    }
//After everything runs and we don't reach base case
    return false
}

{% endhighlight %}

By now we realize that the our time complexity (our branches we have to check) can be in the worst case, each element of the word bank *n*.  Our maximum length of the tree would similarly depend on the length of the target *m*, so at each node we potentially have to check *n* branches for the entire length of *m* that results in O(n<sup>m</sup>) time.  We also create a new suffix in each of our loops so ultimately our worst time complexity is O(n<sup>m</sup> * m).

#### Make it dynamic

We can make this a little faster by introducing a memo object, and potentially save from repeatedly making the same recursive calls.  

{% highlight javascript %}

const canConstruct = (target, wordBank) => {
    let memo = {}
    if (target in memo) return memo[target]
    if (target === '') {
        return true
    }

    for (let string of wordBank) {


    if (target.indexOf(string) === 0) {

    let suffix = target.slice(string.length)

        if (canConstruct(suffix, wordBank) === true) {
    
    //When we return in our recursive call, we should also store this in the memo 

            memo[target] = true
            return true
            }
        } 
    }
    //When we return in our recursive call, we should also store this in the memo 

    memo[target] = false
    return false
}

{% endhighlight %}

Instead of brute force time complexity of O(n<sup>m</sup> * m), we now only have to calculate a maximum of *n* branches.  We do add an additional memo object in addition to the sliced variable so ultimately our time complexity is O(n * m<sup>2</sup>)

#### Slight Tweak to Count Combinations
Our canConstruct decision procedure can also then be tweaked to give us the total number of combinations that can construct our target word.

{% highlight javascript %}

const countConstruct = (target, wordBank) => {
    let memo = {}

    if (target in memo) return memo[target]
    
    //Base case now returns a count of 1 meaning we have constructed the word

    if (target === '') return 1

    //We track the total count throughout each successive recursive call

    let totalCount = 0

    for (let string of wordBank) {
        if (target.indexOf(string) === 0) {
        let suffix = target.slice(string.length)

    //We recursively call on our suffix, and update *totalCount*

        const restNum = countConstruct(suffix, wordBank)
        totalCount += restNum
        } 
    }
  memo[target] = totalCount
}
