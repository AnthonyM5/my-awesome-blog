title: String Compression Algorithm

This LeetCode question was a good lesson for me and an example of how applying certain parameters can turn an easier problem into one that required more familiarity with various built-in functions in JavaScript.  It was also a helpful reminder to strategize and either run through a pseudo-code scenario or otherwise diagram the problem before writing any code.
